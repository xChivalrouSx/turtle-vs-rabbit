# turtle-vs-rabbit
### My first programming project from university :)

---

In this project, a race is simulated between rabbit and turtle. In each round, dices are rolling separately for rabbit and turtle. Race finishes when the one of them is reach the finish line.

#### Turtle:
Dice can be 1, 2 or 3 for turtle.
* Turtle always moves forward. 

---

#### Rabbit:
Dice can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 for rabbit. 
* Rabbit moves forward by the value of the dice, if dice is 1, 2, 3 or 6. 
* Rabbit moves backward by the value of the dice, if dice is 4. 
* Rabbit waits 2 tours, if dice is 5.
